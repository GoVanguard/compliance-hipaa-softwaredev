# Who certifies HIPAA compliance?

## The short answer is no one.

Unlike PCI, there is no one that can “certify” that an organization is HIPAA compliant. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the federal governing body that determines the state of compliance through a thorough audit. HHS does not endorse or recognize the “certifications” made by private organizations.

There is an evaluation standard in the Security Rule § 164.308(a)(8), and it requires you to perform a periodic technical and non-technical evaluation to make sure that your security policies and procedures meet the security requirements outlined in the rule. HHS doesn’t care if the evaluation is performed internally or by an external organization—just as long as it happens. Ideally it is best to use the [HHS' own HIPAA Audit Protocol] (https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/audit/protocol/index.html).

That said, being evaluated by an independent, third party auditor is still a really good idea. Even though it's not official you should still do it. There are a number of great companies that can help you with this process. For example, [GoVanguard](https://govanguard.io) offers HIPAA Risk Assessments that can let you know how you stack up to the requirements outlined by the legislation. Again, be sure that the independant, third party auditor atleast runs your organization through the [HHS' own HIPAA Audit Protocol] (https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/audit/protocol/index.html); if they aren't then most likely the HIPAA Risk Assessment being offering isn't comprehensive. 

**This is important.** Even if you get a "certification" from an external organization then it should be more appropriately reffered to as an attestation. The HHS can still come in and find a security violation, third party audits and "certifications"(attestations) do not absolve you from your legal obligations under the Security Rule.

**Note**
There is an information security framework (not a regulatory law) called HITRUST CSF that is closely alligned with HIPAA specifications and in many cases more concretely builds upon HIPAA. Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors formed the HITRUST alliance to regulate the interpretation of inconsistent views on data security standards. HITRUST, in partner with other industry leaders, created the Common Security Framework (CSF) to be the premier model for the future of healthcare compliance validation. Because HIPAA mandates are so convoluted, HITRUST CSF Certification gives additional rationale for businesses to uphold a higher standard in regards to the value of data. HITRUST CSF Certification is a certification that is is established after a rigorous third party audit that recognizes complete compliance with HIPAA regulations and more.
