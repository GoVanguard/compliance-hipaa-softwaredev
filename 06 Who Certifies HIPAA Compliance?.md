# Who certifies HIPAA compliance?

## The short answer is no one.

Unlike PCI, there is no one that can “certify” that an organization is HIPAA compliant. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the federal governing body that determines the state of compliance through a thorough audit. HHS does not endorse or recognize the “certifications” made by private organizations.

There is an evaluation standard in the Security Rule § 164.308(a)(8), and it requires you to perform a periodic technical and non-technical evaluation to make sure that your security policies and procedures meet the security requirements outlined in the rule. HHS doesn’t care if the evaluation is performed internally or by an external organization—just as long as it happens.

That said, being evaluated by an independent, third party auditor is still a really good idea. Even though it's not official you should still do it. There are a number of great companies that can help you with this process. For example, [GoVanguard](https://govanguard.io) offers HIPAA Risk Assessments that can let you know how you stack up to the requirements outlined by the legislation.

**This is important.** Even if you get a "certification" from an external organization, HHS can still come in and find a security violation. Third party audits and "certifications" do not absolve you from your legal obligations under the Security Rule.

**Note**
There is an information security framework called HITRUST CSF that is closely alligned with HIPAA specifications and in many cases more concretely builds 
eaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors formed the HITRUST alliance to regulate the interpretation of inconsistent views on data security standards. HITRUST, in partner with other industry leaders, created the Common Security Framework (CSF) to be the premier model for the future of healthcare compliance validation

The HITRUST CSF Assurance Program delivers simplified compliance assessment and reporting for HIPAA, HITECH, state, and business associate requirements. Leveraging the HITRUST CSF, the program provides organizations and their business associates with a common approach to managing security assessments that creates efficiencies and contains costs associated with multiple and varied assurance requirements.

The HITRUST CSF Assurance Program includes the risk management oversight and assessment methodology governed by HITRUST and designed for the unique regulatory and business needs of various industries.
The foundation of all HITRUST® programs and services is the HITRUST CSF®, a certifiable framework that provides organizations with a comprehensive, flexible and efficient approach to regulatory compliance and risk management.

Many people fail to realize that the Health Information Trust Alliance, known simply as HITRUST, is not a framework at all, but an organization comprised of healthcare industry leaders who regard information security as a fundamental component to data systems and exchanges. The HITRUST organization, in partner with other technology and information security leaders, created and maintains the Common Security Framework (CSF). To become HITRUST CSF certified is regarded to be the pinnacle of compliance, but what is it?

HITRUST CSF Certification is a certification that is is established after a rigorous third party audit that recognizes complete compliance with HIPAA regulations and then some.
The HITRUST CSF Certification demonstrates the importance of privacy and security to business partners while supporting all healthcare information.
Because HIPAA mandates are so convoluted, HITRUST CSF Certification gives additional rationale for business to uphold a higher standard in regards to the value of data.
Why does HITRUST matter? Well, as healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can quickly consume an organization’s resources. If that isn’t enough, getting through all of the twists, turns and pitfalls to achieve compliance is only half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner.
